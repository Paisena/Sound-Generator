This tool is a sound generator.
It generates sound using sine waves, which the user can export as a .wav file.

How to access the tool:
You can either clone the repo or download it as a zip. Then you go to the file named "Sound Generator(Exe Found Here)" and inside is a .exe file named "Sound Generator.exe". That is the executable 
for the tool.

You can create the wave file by pressing the "Export" button, which creates a .wav file called "output.wav" in the directory of the .exe file.

Parameters:
Frequency: Changes the pitch of the sound. Higher values are higher pitches and lower values are lower pitches.
Duration: How long the sound plays.
Amplitude: The volume of the sound. A higher amplitude is louder.
Attack: How long it takes for the sound to reach full volume. Enable ASDR to use this feature.
Decay: How long it takes for the sound to fall from full volume to sustain volume. Enable ASDR to use this feature.
Sustain: The volume level that the sound maintains while playing. Enable ASDR to use this feature.
Release: How long it takes for the sound to fade out after releasing a key. Enable ASDR to use this feature.
Enable ADRS: ADSR stands for Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. If the total of Attack, Decay and Release is longer than the duration,\nthe duration will be set to the total of Attack, Decay, and Release + 0.1 seconds.
Enable Choord: Enabling chord will play several notes at the same time.
Enable 8-Bit: Enabling 8-bit will make the sound more 8-bit.
